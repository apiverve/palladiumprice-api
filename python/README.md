Palladium Price API
============

Palladium Price tracks real-time spot rates for palladium per ounce, gram, and kilogram in USD. It supplies 24-hour price changes and update timestamps, while paid plans add custom currencies and 24-hour hourly history.

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started quickly:

```python
from apiverve_palladiumprice.apiClient import PalladiumpriceAPIClient

# Initialize the client with your APIVerve API key
api = PalladiumpriceAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = {
    "currency": "USD",
    "hourly": true
}

try:
    # Make the API call
    result = api.execute(query)

    # Print the result
    print(result)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

---

## Usage

The Palladium Price API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/palladiumprice](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/palladiumprice?utm_source=pypi&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```python
# Import the client module
from apiverve_palladiumprice.apiClient import PalladiumpriceAPIClient

## Perform Request

Using the API client, you can perform requests to the API.

###### Define Query

```python
query = {
    "currency": "USD",
    "hourly": true
}
```

###### Simple Request

```python
# Make a request to the API
result = api.execute(query)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

###### Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "gram": 40.08,
    "kilogram": 40075.88,
    "ounce": 1246.5,
    "lastUpdated": "2026-02-07T12:00:00.000Z",

      "kilogramWords": "forty thousand, seventy-six dollars"
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The API client provides comprehensive error handling through the `PalladiumpriceAPIClientError` exception. Here are some examples:

### Basic Error Handling

```python
from apiverve_palladiumprice.apiClient import PalladiumpriceAPIClient, PalladiumpriceAPIClientError

api = PalladiumpriceAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = {
    "currency": "USD",
    "hourly": true
}

try:
    result = api.execute(query)
    print("Success!")
    print(result)
except PalladiumpriceAPIClientError as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e.message}")
    if e.status_code:
        print(f"Status Code: {e.status_code}")
    if e.response:
        print(f"Response: {e.response}")
```

### Handling Specific Error Types

```python
from apiverve_palladiumprice.apiClient import PalladiumpriceAPIClient, PalladiumpriceAPIClientError

api = PalladiumpriceAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = {
    "currency": "USD",
    "hourly": true
}

try:
    result = api.execute(query)

    # Check for successful response
    if result.get('status') == 'success':
        print("Request successful!")
        print(result.get('data'))
    else:
        print(f"API returned an error: {result.get('error')}")

except PalladiumpriceAPIClientError as e:
    # Handle API client errors
    if e.status_code == 401:
        print("Unauthorized: Invalid API key")
    elif e.status_code == 429:
        print("Rate limit exceeded")
    elif e.status_code >= 500:
        print("Server error - please try again later")
    else:
        print(f"API error: {e.message}")
except Exception as e:
    # Handle unexpected errors
    print(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
```

### Using Context Manager (Recommended)

The client supports the context manager protocol for automatic resource cleanup:

```python
from apiverve_palladiumprice.apiClient import PalladiumpriceAPIClient, PalladiumpriceAPIClientError

query = {
    "currency": "USD",
    "hourly": true
}

# Using context manager ensures proper cleanup
with PalladiumpriceAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]") as api:
    try:
        result = api.execute(query)
        print(result)
    except PalladiumpriceAPIClientError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e.message}")
# Session is automatically closed here
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see detailed request and response information:

```python
from apiverve_palladiumprice.apiClient import PalladiumpriceAPIClient

# Enable debug mode
api = PalladiumpriceAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]", debug=True)

query = {
    "currency": "USD",
    "hourly": true
}

# Debug information will be printed to console
result = api.execute(query)
```

### Manual Session Management

If you need to manually manage the session lifecycle:

```python
from apiverve_palladiumprice.apiClient import PalladiumpriceAPIClient

api = PalladiumpriceAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = {
    "currency": "USD",
    "hourly": true
}

try:
    result = api.execute(query)
    print(result)
finally:
    # Manually close the session when done
    api.close()
```
